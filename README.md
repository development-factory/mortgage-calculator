Simple Java application designed to generate a csv spreadsheet for a mortgage or loan. The user needs to input the amount, time period and interest rate and a .csv report will be generated at the location of the project named "mortgage-report&timestamp.csv".

The result is similar to what you get from the bank when applying for a house mortgage or loan.
